## Introduction

This repository contains a UML sequence diagram that visually represents the interactions and communication flow within a Supply Chain Management system. The diagram provides insights into how various components and entities collaborate to manage the supply chain processes effectively.

## Diagram Overview

The UML sequence diagram demonstrates the step-by-step interactions involved in the supply chain management process:

1. **Placing an Order**:
   - The **Customer** initiates the process by sending a `Place Order` request to the **Order Processing System**.
   - The **Order Processing System** checks the stock availability in the **Warehouse** to fulfill the order.
   - If the required stock is available, the system reserves the stock and informs the **Customer** that the order has been successfully placed.
   - If stock is unavailable, the **Order Processing System** notifies the **Customer** about the unavailability and initiates a request to the **Supplier** for stock replenishment.

2. **Shipping Process**:
   - Once the stock is reserved, the **Order Processing System** generates a `Create Shipping Request` message and sends it to the **Shipping Service**.
   - The **Shipping Service** acknowledges the request and assigns the stock to the shipment.
   - Upon assignment, the **Shipping Service** initiates the shipment process and informs the **Order Processing System** about the shipment initiation.
   - The **Order Processing System** notifies the **Customer** that the order has been shipped.

3. **Warehouse Management**:
   - After the shipment is initiated, the **Order Processing System** releases the previously reserved stock in the **Warehouse**.
   - The **Warehouse** confirms the stock release to the **Order Processing System**.

## Using the Diagram

You can use this UML sequence diagram as a visual aid to understand the flow of interactions within a Supply Chain Management system. It depicts the collaboration between the **Customer**, **Order Processing System**, **Warehouse**, **Shipping Service**, and potential interactions with the **Supplier**.

Feel free to analyze, adapt, or integrate this diagram into your own projects to enhance your understanding of supply chain management processes.
